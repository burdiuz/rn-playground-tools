# react-native Playground Tools
Tools created for [react-native Playground](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actualwave.reactnativeplayground) android application. 
These are external tools which can be movified in Playground app or updated by copying simply files.

## This repo
This repo might be temporary. I have a plan to move all Tools, Run Containers and Templates to separate Gists and add a function to Playground to update from these gists. With this approach, updating external tools will not require making a new APK. But on the other hand there will be no pull requests and other repo stuff. If I'll get some time to manage auto-updating gist when this repo get's a pull request, there will be no need to remove it.
